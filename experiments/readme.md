exp1.m: A simple demo for PIVnet, you can specify the images with a standard dialog box for retrieving files. $Visual results, contour plot, histogram of the velocity components, turbulent energy spectrum$

exp2.m: The performance investigation (RMS error) of PIVnet with respect to different *particle diameters*. $Uniform Flow$

exp3.m: The performance investigation (RMS error) of PIVnet with respect to different *particle concentration* (unit: particles per pixel,ppp). $Uniform Flow$

exp4.m: The performance investigation (RMS error) of PIVnet with respect to different *noise level*. $Uniform Flow$


exp5.m: The performance investigation (RMS error) of PIVnet in comparison with FFT-CC and WIDIM methods. $Uniform Flow$ 

exp6.m: The Modulation Transfer Function of PIVnet. $sinusoidal displacement distribution$.
